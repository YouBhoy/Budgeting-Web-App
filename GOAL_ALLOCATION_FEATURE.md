# ðŸŽ¯ Goal Allocation Feature

## **What is Goal Allocation?**

The **Goal Allocation Feature** is a powerful new capability that connects your **income transactions** directly to your **budget goals**. Instead of manually updating goal progress, you can now automatically allocate portions of your income to specific financial goals when you add income transactions.

## **How It Works**

### **1. When Adding Income**
- When you select "Income" as the transaction type, a new section appears: **"ðŸŽ¯ Allocate to Budget Goals"**
- You can choose to allocate portions of your income to your active budget goals
- The system prevents you from allocating more than your total income amount

### **2. Smart Validation**
- âœ… **Total allocation cannot exceed income amount**
- âœ… **Only shows active goals** (goals that haven't been completed yet)
- âœ… **Real-time calculation** of total allocated vs remaining amount
- âœ… **Visual feedback** when over-allocating

### **3. Automatic Goal Updates**
- When you submit the transaction, goal progress is automatically updated
- No need to manually update goal progress separately
- Transaction and goal updates happen in a single database transaction for data integrity

## **Step-by-Step Usage**

### **Step 1: Add Income Transaction**
1. Go to **"Add New Transaction"**
2. Select **"ðŸ’° Income"** as transaction type
3. Enter amount, description, and category

### **Step 2: Enable Goal Allocation**
1. Check the box: **"Allocate this income to my budget goals"**
2. The goal allocation form will appear

### **Step 3: Allocate to Goals**
1. **View your active goals** with current progress and remaining amounts
2. **Enter amounts** for each goal you want to allocate to
3. **Monitor the totals** at the bottom:
   - **Total Allocated**: Sum of all goal allocations
   - **Remaining**: Income amount minus total allocated

### **Step 4: Submit**
1. Click **"ðŸ’¾ Add Transaction"**
2. Both the transaction and goal updates are saved
3. Success message: **"Transaction added successfully! Goals updated!"**
